# Beefy Billy's Ordering and Delivery Service

## Project Description

Restaurant Delivery App is a web-app designed to facilitate Customers ordering food from a restaurant online for delivery or pick up. The Customer is also able to create a reservation at the restaurant for a future date. Employees of this establishment are able to view pending orders and update the status as completed or canceled, as well as submit new orders if the Customer orders over the phone. Employees may also view and update the list of reservations as well as make a reservation for Customers. Managers can make changes to the menu as well as see a list of all orders regardless of status. Managers can also create Employees.
